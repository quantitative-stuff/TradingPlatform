# Phase 3: Feature Engineering Implementation - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. WAP (Weighted Average Price) Implementation
- Added `wap()` method to `OrderBook` in `market-types/src/orderbook.rs`
- Calculates volume-weighted average price within specified depth (in basis points)
- Used in feature calculation at multiple time horizons (0ms, 100ms, 200ms, 300ms)

### ✅ 2. OFI (Order Flow Imbalance) Features
- Implemented `calc_ofi()` in `feature-engineering/src/calculator.rs`
- Calculates net buy/sell order flow over time windows
- Tracks order additions with directional information

### ✅ 3. Additional Market Microstructure Features

Implemented in `feature-engineering/src/calculator.rs`:

**Order Book Features:**
- `order_book_imbalance`: Bid vs ask quantity at best levels
- `liquidity_imbalance`: Total liquidity within depth threshold
- `queue_imbalance`: Number of bid vs ask levels

**Trade Flow Features:**
- `tick_flow_imbalance`: Directional trade count
- `trade_flow_imbalance`: Volume-weighted trade flow

**Spread Features:**
- `spread`: Absolute spread
- `spread_bps`: Spread in basis points

**Volume Features:**
- `bid_volume_10bps` / `ask_volume_10bps`: Volume at 10bp depth
- `bid_volume_20bps` / `ask_volume_20bps`: Volume at 20bp depth

### ✅ 4. Type System Refactoring

Unified type system across crates:

**market-types crate** (central type definitions):
- `Exchange`, `Side`, `Trade`, `OrderBook`, `OrderBookUpdate`, `PriceLevel`
- `OrderEvent` (L3 events)
- `MarketFeatures` (calculated features)
- `Signal`, `SignalType` (trading signals)
- `NBBO` (best bid/offer aggregation)

**matching-engine/types** (trading-specific):
- `Order`, `OrderType`, `OrderStatus`, `TimeInForce`
- `Position`, `PerformanceMetrics`

### ✅ 5. Feature Engineering Pipeline

Created modular architecture:

**`feature-engineering/src/history.rs`:**
- `OrderBookHistory`: Time-series order book snapshots
- `TradeHistory`: Trade event history
- `OrderEventHistory`: L3 order event tracking

**`feature-engineering/src/calculator.rs`:**
- `FeatureCalculator`: Core feature computation
- Maintains historical state for time-based features
- All feature calculations in one place

**`feature-engineering/src/pipeline.rs`:**
- `FeaturePipeline`: End-to-end integration
- Connects `MatchingEngine` → `FeatureCalculator`
- Processes L2 updates → L3 events → Features

## Testing

All tests passing:
```bash
cargo test -p feature-engineering --lib
```

**Test Coverage:**
- `test_order_book_imbalance`: Validates bid/ask imbalance calculation
- `test_liquidity_imbalance`: Validates depth-based liquidity calculation
- `test_pipeline_basic_flow`: End-to-end pipeline integration test

## Usage Example

```rust
use feature_engineering::FeaturePipeline;
use market_types::{OrderBookUpdate, Exchange, PriceLevel};

// Create pipeline with 1-second lookback
let pipeline = FeaturePipeline::new(1000);

// Process order book update
let update = OrderBookUpdate {
    exchange: Exchange::Binance,
    symbol: "BTCUSDT".to_string(),
    timestamp: 1000000,
    bids: vec![PriceLevel { price: 100.0, quantity: 10.0 }],
    asks: vec![PriceLevel { price: 101.0, quantity: 8.0 }],
    is_snapshot: true,
};

// Get calculated features
let features = pipeline.process_order_book_update(update)?;

// Access feature values
if let Some(features) = features {
    println!("Spread: {:?}", features.spread);
    println!("WAP: {:?}", features.wap_0ms);
    println!("OBI: {:?}", features.order_book_imbalance);
}
```

## Build Status

```bash
cargo check --workspace --lib
```
✅ All workspace libraries compile successfully
⚠️ 74 non-critical warnings in feeder (unused variables, dead code)

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Signal Generation**: Implement signal strategies using `MarketFeatures`
2. **Backtesting**: Create backtesting framework for strategy evaluation
3. **OMS Integration**: Connect signals to order execution
4. **Database**: Re-enable QuestDB for historical storage
5. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
6. **Enhanced OFI**: Add side information to Execute events for better OFI calculation
